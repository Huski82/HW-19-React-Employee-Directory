## Installation:
To create this application, you would have to run `npx create-react "name of project"` which will provide you a npm dependencies such as node_modules & package-lock.json and SRC files for REACT. However, if users only need to install package.json they can run `npm init -y` on the command-line. 

`React.js` 
`VSCode`
`Bootstrap`


## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

* An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter  employees by name.
